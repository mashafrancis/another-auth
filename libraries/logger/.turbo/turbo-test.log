ts-jest[ts-jest-transformer] (WARN) Got a `.js` file to compile while `allowJs` option is not set to `true` (file: /Users/goldbergyoni/solutions/practica/src/code-templates/libraries/request-context/.dist/index.js). To fix this:
  - if you want TypeScript to process JS files, set `allowJs` to `true` in your TypeScript config (usually tsconfig.json)
  - if you do not want TypeScript to process your `.js` files, in your Jest config change the `transform` key which value is `ts-jest` so that it does not match `.js` files anymore

  logger
    ✓ When no explicit configuration is set, info logs are written (3 ms)
    ✓ When log level is DEBUG and logger emits INFO statement, then stdout contains the entry (1 ms)
    ✓ When logger is configured and then re-configured, then the new config applies
    ✓ When log level is ERROR and logger emits INFO statement, then nothing is written (1 ms)
    ✓ When configuring for pretty-print, then its written to stdout
    ✓ it should print the passed metadata (1 ms)
    context
      ✓ it should print the current context
      ✓ it should merge with current context (1 ms)
      ✓ it should override current context
